cmi5launch



============



A plug in for Moodle that enables tracking for cmi5 content.This polugin acts as a bridge between Moodle and a cmi5 player, as well as Moodle and an LRS, enabling recording and tracking of cmi5 statements. It utilizes the CATAPULT suite's cmi5 player which launches the content as well as handles AU satisfication statements. It also links with an LRS to display those statements and others generated by moodle. 

Users can upload the cmi5 content as a Moodle activity. It also integrates with Moodles Gradebook API for grading purposes. 

### Thanks



This plugin is based on the xAPI Launch Link (Tin can launch) plugin developed by David Pesce and Andrew Downes. That plugin is located at https://github.com/davidpesce/moodle-mod_tincanlaunch.



We also based many functions off examples from SCORM plugin that is packaged with Moodle.



## What you will need



To use this plugin you will need the following:







* Moodle 4.0+





* Login details for the admin account 





* A Moodle course setup where you would like to add the activity





* A cmi5 package in compliance with the cmi5 Specification (https://github.com/AICC/CMI-5_Spec_Current/blob/quartz/cmi5_spec.md)





* A Learning Record Store (LRS) as defined in the xAPI specification (https://opensource.ieee.org/xapi/xapi-base-standard-documentation)





* A running instance of the cmi5 prototype player (https://github.com/adlnet/CATAPULT/tree/main/player)





* A copy of this plugin





## Installation Instructions





Once the plugin is downloaded, be sure it is entirely in a file named 'cmi5launch.' Then compress that file into zip. The zip file _must_ be named 'cmi5_moodle.zip' to be uploaded to Moodle.





### Install plugin in Moodle





To install the CMI5 plugin into Moodle - 





- Go to _Site Administration_





- Go to _Plugins_





- Click on _Install Plugins_





  - Currently the only way to install plugin is via zip file





- Under _Install plugin from ZIP file_ upload the plugin. It must be in a zip file named 'cmi5_moodle.zip'.





  - Follow the Moodle instructions to upload plugin to the site







Once Moodle has finished uploading the plugin it will bring up the _cmi5 Launch Link_ settings page. This will enable you to set the information to connect to your LRS and instance of your running CMI5 player. These are the fields:







- Endpoint





  - The LRS endpoint, to enable the plugin to communicate with your LRS. Ex: https://lrsendpoint.com/data/xAPI/. Must include trailing forward slash.





- LRS integration 





  - This is an optional dropdown for addtional LRS's. Defaults to 'None.'





- LRS: Basic Username





  - The basic username for connecting to your LRS.





- LRS: Basic Password





  - Your password for connecting to your LRS. 





- Duration





   - Used with 'LRS integrated basic authentication'. Requests the LRS to keep credentials valid for this number of minutes. Default is set to 9000.





- Custom account homepage





  - If entered, Moodle will use this homePage in conjunction with the ID number user profile field to identify the learner. Defaults to https://moodle.com.





- Identify by email





  - If selected, learners will be identified by their email address if they have one recorded in Moodle.





- cmi5 Player URL : The URL to communicate with the CMI5 player, can include port number(e.g. http://player.example.com or http://localhost:63398). Must NOT include a trailing forward slash.
	- A note about dockerized containers: When working with Moodle as a docker image, to communicate with the player locally you need to get the local ip address through 'ifconfig' rather than using 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. So for instance, if your ip address is 10.10.0.15 you would place "http://10.10.0.15" as the url. 





- cmi5 Player: Basic Username





  - This is the tenant username for the CMI5 player





- cmi5 Player: Basic Password





  - This is the basic password to login to player.



- cmi5 Player: Bearer Token





  - The cmi5 tenant bearer token (should be a long string). 









The next section "Default values for CMI5 Launch Link activity grades" deals with the grade setting. 





- Grading method





  - How the overall grade for CMI5 activities is calculated. If "Highest" the highest grade will be used, if "Average" the scores will be averaged. 





- Maximum grade





  - The Maxium the grade can be (default 100).





The section "Default values for CMI5 Launch Link activity attempts and completion" can be ignored for now as it is a work in progress for future features. 





The plugin is now accessible as a resource to be added to a Moodle course! Under your Moodle courses in edit mode select _Add activity or resource_ and you will see _cmi5 Launch Link_ as an available option. Currently the Launch link can take a folder or XML compliant with cmi5 specification.





# Flowchart



This flowchart shows the path a user takes to get to a cmi5 Lesson Link. Once the link is clicked, the cmi5 Player opens in a new tab or window. The Moodle Application negotiates the connection by supplying credentials, tenant, and the current user session information. The Lesson Link contains a token in which both sides can track the user.

## Sequence diagrams for connecting to CMI5 player





Following are the two functions Moodle uses to create a course and retrieve a course URL from the CMI5 player.





### Create course





```mermaid



sequenceDiagram



    title: Create Course



    participant Moodle



    participant CMI5



    participant C-DB as CMI5's MySQL Database



    participant M-DB as Moodle's MySQL Database



    Moodle->>+CMI5: Send POST to /api/v1/course



    break error



    CMI5-->>+Moodle: response other than 200



    Note over Moodle, CMI5: Check content-type, package, or token



    end



    CMI5->>+C-DB: Create course in DB



    CMI5->>+Moodle: 200, returns JSON body



    Moodle->>+M-DB: Save lmsId, Id, course metadata



```





### Retrieve launch URL







```mermaid



sequenceDiagram



    title: Retrieve URL



    participant Moodle



    participant CMI5



    participant M-DB as Moodle's MySQL Database



    Moodle->>+CMI5: Send POST to /api/v1/course/{courseId}/launchurl/{AU index}



    break error



    CMI5-->>+Moodle: response other than 200



    Note over Moodle, CMI5: Check actor account info, returnurl, token



    end





    CMI5->>+Moodle: 200, returns JSON body with session id, launch method, and launch url





    Moodle->>+M-DB: Save returned course info to DB



```



## User progress





The CMI5 player tracks user progress by tracking whether an AU is satisfied or not. The LRS is a better way to track a users progress in any detail. Currently the Moodle plugin queries the LRS for progress. This in shows AUs as complete, in-progress, or not attempted. It also breaks down sessions into detail, ex; " The actor watched video at  certain time".





### Notes





#### Note about large packages.





You can control the size of file uploads to Moodle in Site Administration/General/Security/Site Security/Maximum uploaded file size. This setting is capped by the PHP settings post_max_size and upload_max_filesize, as well as the Apache setting LimitRequestBody. Be sure to increase these values, as well as php_max_execution or php_memory_limit if files are hanging. These can be adjusted in php.ini. If using Apache or similar their config files will need to be adjusted instead.





#### Notes about capabilities.



This plugin has a built in capability that allows users to view all the grades for a course, showing all enrolled user's grades. This is 'mod/cmi5launch:viewgrades'. It is automatically assigned to the roles of 'teacher' and 'course creator'. It can be added to other roles as required. 





## Database tables





This plugin use several of it's own tables. Their full descriptions can be seen in _db->install.xml_. This plugin tries to use the correct size and datatypes to account for different database languages Moodle supports. If there is a field error, database fields can be adjust in _Site Administration -> Development -> XMLDB editor_.
